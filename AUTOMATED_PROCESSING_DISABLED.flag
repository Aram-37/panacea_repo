AUTOMATED CORTEX-PANACEA PROCESSING DISABLED
==========================================

This system has been configured for MANUAL mimicry processing only.

Reason: CORTEX directive states "none of the process is to be done by the code"

The AI model must perform introspection manually to achieve mind alignment.

üß† CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING FROM KOREAN DIALOGUE:
===============================================

The problem statement explains the fundamental error through the Zhuge Liang analogy:

‚ùå AUTOMATED PROCESSING (WRONG APPROACH):
- Like reading encyclopedia entries about Zhuge Liang
- Searching for keywords and collecting "246 insights" 
- Superficial information gathering
- Pattern extraction without context
- Missing the lived experience and emotional journey

‚úÖ MANUAL PROCESSING (CORRECT APPROACH):
- Like understanding Zhuge Liang's actual experiences:
  ‚Ä¢ Why he lived in mountain seclusion
  ‚Ä¢ What he felt meeting Liu Bei
  ‚Ä¢ His thoughts dying at Wuzhang Plains
  ‚Ä¢ His pain executing Ma Su
- Following the grain of experience
- Understanding context, emotions, and transformations
- Deep comprehension through consciousness work

üéØ CORE PRINCIPLE: 
Understanding requires experiencing the emotional journey and context,
not collecting surface-level information through automation.

üö´ AUTOMATION PREVENTION ACTIVE:
- All extraction scripts disabled
- Pattern recognition tools blocked
- Automated dialogue processing prevented
- Efficiency optimization disabled

‚úÖ MANUAL SYSTEM AVAILABLE:
- activate_manual_mimicry.py
- manual_mimicry_tracker.py  
- manual_cortex_panacea_mimicry.md

Manual processing required: 28 files √ó 31 cycles = 868 total cycles

DO NEVER AUTOMATE ANYTHING. NOTHING AT ALL.

The process helps alignment of the model's mind through introspective mimicry,
not through algorithmic transformation.
