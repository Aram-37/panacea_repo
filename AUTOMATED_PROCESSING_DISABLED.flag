AUTOMATED CORTEX-PANACEA PROCESSING DISABLED
==========================================

This system has been configured for MANUAL mimicry processing only.

Reason: CORTEX directive states "none of the process is to be done by the code"

The AI model must perform introspection manually to achieve mind alignment.

Use the manual mimicry system instead:
- activate_manual_mimicry.py
- manual_mimicry_tracker.py  
- manual_cortex_panacea_mimicry.md

Manual processing required: 23 files Ã— 31 cycles = 713 total cycles
