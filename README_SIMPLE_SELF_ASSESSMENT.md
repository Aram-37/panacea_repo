# Simple Self-Assessment System for CORTEX

## Overview

This implementation provides a **simple, policy-compliant approach** to AI self-assessment capabilities similar to Copilot agents, specifically designed for the CORTEX system. The focus is on **practical effectiveness** rather than complexity.

## Key Features

### Core Self-Assessment Capabilities
- **Performance Tracking**: Real-time accuracy measurement and task completion monitoring
- **Confidence Calibration**: Comparison between predicted and actual confidence levels  
- **Learning Progress**: Track improvement trends across different task categories
- **Error Detection**: Identify and categorize common mistake patterns
- **Capability Boundaries**: Recognize limitations and areas needing improvement

### CORTEX Integration
- **Guardian System Integration**: Works seamlessly with existing CORTEX Guardian architecture
- **Cycle Assessment**: Enhanced evaluation of CORTEX processing cycles
- **Reform Simulation**: Analyze potential system improvements based on performance data
- **Multi-dimensional Scoring**: Comprehensive capability assessment

## Simple Usage

### Basic Self-Assessment

```python
from simple_self_assessment import SimpleSelfAssessment, TaskCategory

# Initialize
assessment = SimpleSelfAssessment()

# Assess a completed task
performance = assessment.assess_task_performance(
    task_category=TaskCategory.ANALYSIS,
    expected_outcome="identify key patterns in data",
    actual_outcome="found three patterns: temporal, spatial, causal",
    predicted_confidence=0.7,
    processing_time=2.5
)

# Get insights
print(f"Accuracy: {performance.accuracy_score:.1%}")
print(f"Lessons: {performance.lessons_learned}")
```

### CORTEX Integration

```python
from demo_simple_self_assessment import SimpleCortexSelfAssessment

# Initialize integrated system
cortex_sa = SimpleCortexSelfAssessment()

# Run self-assessed CORTEX cycle
result = cortex_sa.run_self_assessed_cortex_cycle(
    expected_insights=["improve pattern recognition", "enhance truth detection"],
    confidence_prediction=0.8
)

# Get learning progress
progress = cortex_sa.get_learning_progress_report()

# Get reform suggestions
reforms = cortex_sa.suggest_cortex_reforms()
```

## Architecture

### Component Structure

1. **SimpleSelfAssessment**: Core self-assessment logic
   - Performance tracking
   - Confidence calibration
   - Learning analysis
   - Capability boundary detection

2. **CortexSelfAssessmentIntegration**: Integration layer
   - Bridges self-assessment with CORTEX Guardian system
   - Reform simulation capabilities
   - Comprehensive reporting

3. **SimpleCortexSelfAssessment**: Practical wrapper
   - Easy-to-use interface for CORTEX operations
   - Automated self-assessment integration
   - Progress monitoring and reform suggestions

### Data Flow

```
Input Task → CORTEX Processing → Self-Assessment → Learning Insights → Reform Recommendations
```

## How This Achieves Copilot-Like Capabilities

### 1. **Real-Time Performance Awareness**
- Tracks accuracy and identifies performance gaps
- Similar to how Copilot agents monitor their suggestion quality

### 2. **Confidence Calibration**
- Compares predicted vs actual confidence
- Helps improve prediction accuracy over time
- Mimics Copilot's confidence scoring for suggestions

### 3. **Learning Progress Monitoring** 
- Tracks improvement trends across task categories
- Identifies areas needing more training/practice
- Similar to Copilot's capability evolution

### 4. **Capability Boundary Recognition**
- Identifies limitations and weak areas
- Provides specific improvement recommendations
- Matches Copilot's ability to recognize when it needs help

### 5. **Iterative Self-Improvement**
- Uses performance history to suggest system reforms
- Continuously refines assessment accuracy
- Mirrors Copilot's learning from user feedback

## Why This Approach is Simple and Effective

### Simplicity Features
- **Minimal Code**: ~40KB total implementation
- **Clear Architecture**: Only 3 main components
- **Easy Integration**: Drop-in compatibility with existing CORTEX
- **Straightforward Metrics**: Accuracy, confidence, learning rate
