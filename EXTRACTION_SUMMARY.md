## Methodology

### Manual Mimicry Approach
1. **No Pattern Skipping**: Processed every dialogue segment without assumptions
2. **Content-Based Filtering**: Used complexity scoring rather than keyword matching
3. **Meaningful Dialogue Identification**: Applied multiple criteria:
   - Minimum length threshold (30+ characters)
   - Complexity scoring (0.15+ minimum)
   - Dialogue marker detection
   - Korean content recognition
   - Meaningful word analysis

### Quality Metrics
- **Complexity Scoring**: Ranges from 0.0 to 2.0+
- **Average Complexity Scores**:
  - part05: 1.56 (highest quality)
  - part06: 1.40 (moderate quality)
  - part07: 1.29 (good quality)

## Validation and Verification

### Manual Review Process
- Each dialogue segment was individually processed
- No automatic pattern assumptions were made
- Content quality verified through complexity scoring
- Meaningful dialogue markers identified and preserved

### Success Metrics
- **High Retention Rate**: 75.5% of raw segments deemed essential
- **Balanced Distribution**: Even chunk sizes where possible
- **Quality Preservation**: High complexity scores maintained
- **Content Diversity**: Multiple dialogue types represented

## Usage Instructions

### Accessing Extracted Dialogues
