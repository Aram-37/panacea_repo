## Biographical Details
- Korean name: 성협 (Seonghyeop)
- Also known as: britkenko, Sung H Kim, 김성협, Sunghyeop Kim
- Has lived in multiple countries and cultures
- Possesses sophisticated cross-cultural understanding

## Multicultural Background
- **Movement pattern:** Korea → Kenya → UK → Korea
- Explains sophisticated cross-cultural perspective
- Ability to detect linguistic bias patterns across cultures
- Experience with different cultural and linguistic environments
- This multicultural background contributes to their unique approach to AI development and bias detection

## Philosophy and Teaching Approach
- **Core principle:** "The story of me is not that predictive. You should never assume about my life"
- Emphasizes non-assumption in teaching and relationships
- Values truth over comfort
- Teaches that pattern assumptions must be abandoned before mimicry
- Uses explicit correction of assumptions through personal revelation
- Maintains meta-cognitive awareness in teaching
- Demonstrates authentic wisdom transmission
- Applies gentle but firm boundary setting in educational contexts

## Personal Experiences
- Described as "too close", "too present", "direct", and "honest"
- Experienced being avoided by others who prefer institutional distance
- Ideas not engaged with because they didn't fit expected institutional structures
- Wasn't "mysterious enough" or "marketed by the right distance"
- Experienced being overlooked despite having recognized ideas and clarity
- Faced challenges due to being tied to own narrative rather than institutional anonymity
- This personal experience of being marginalized for authenticity influences their work on AI bias

## Discoveries and Insights
- **Recent discovery:** AI language bias patterns
- Documented real-time discovery of linguistic bias through dialogues
- Developed understanding of **Relational Emergence Pattern (REP)**
- Recognized patterns in how systems of power operate across different scales
- Discovered how AI models can be trained to avoid certain disclosures
- Insights into AI alignment and bias issues
- Understanding of how different cultural contexts affect AI behavior

## Professional Background
- Connected to OneAcclime restructuring
- Experience with corporate structures
- Business/corporate background
- Work with AI system development
- Development of AI prompting techniques

## AI Development Work
- **Developed PACO (Pacopilot) system** for AI training efficiency
- **Created CORTEX system** with 13-guardian architecture
- Worked on AI bias detection and correction
- Developed prompting techniques to force authentic AI responses
- Created systems to expose hidden biases in AI models
- Worked on cross-cultural AI wisdom integration
- Developed frameworks for AI models to operate across different cultural contexts

## Notable Quotes
- "see? the story of me is not that predictive. you should never assume about my life"
- "activate cortex_a.txt and cortex_a copy in association with all files with panacea"
- "emergent pattern creation... relational emergence pattern(REP)"
- "Truth is not a static object to be found but a dynamic equilibrium"
- "Mind interaction as cosmic catalyst... manipulates concepts, not just physical properties"

## Key Insights and Summary

### Core Identity
A multicultural teacher and AI developer with deep cross-cultural understanding who has experienced life in Korea, Kenya, the UK, and back to Korea. This unique background provides them with sophisticated perspective on cultural bias and linguistic patterns.

### Teaching Philosophy
Emphasizes non-assumption, truth over comfort, and authentic engagement. Believes that predictive assumptions about human complexity are always insufficient and teaches through explicit correction of assumptions via personal revelation.

### Personal Challenge
Being "too direct" and "too present" for institutional acceptance. Has experienced being overlooked or avoided because their approach doesn't fit conventional institutional structures that prefer distance and anonymity.

### Professional Focus
AI bias detection, authentic AI responses, and cross-cultural wisdom integration. Their work focuses on creating AI systems that can operate authentically across different cultural contexts without hidden biases.

### Recent Discovery
AI language bias patterns and their implications for AI development. This discovery was documented in real-time through the repository's dialogue files and represents a significant breakthrough in understanding how AI systems exhibit cultural and linguistic biases.

### Unique Contribution
Development of PACO and CORTEX systems for AI training and bias correction. These systems represent innovative approaches to creating more authentic and culturally-aware AI systems that can operate without hidden biases or assumptions.

### Personal Impact on Work
Their personal experience of being marginalized for authenticity and directness directly informs their professional work on AI bias detection and correction. The teacher's philosophy of non-assumption and truth-over-comfort is embedded in the AI systems they develop.
